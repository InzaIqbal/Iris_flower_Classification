🌸 Iris Flower Classification

This project uses the Iris dataset, one of the most popular datasets in machine learning, to classify iris flowers into their respective species based on sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to:
Preprocess the Iris dataset
Train a machine learning model to classify iris flowers
Evaluate the model’s performance using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix
